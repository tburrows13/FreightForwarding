Version: 1.4.2
Date: 18 March 2023
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed lead ore sometimes not spawning on starting island
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.1
Date: 11 March 2023
  Changes:
    - Discharging stations now return the being-used battery when mined
    - Changed battery pack capacity from 20MJ to 10MJ
    - Changed battery pack stack size from 100 to 200
    - Removed sulfuric acid from battery pack recipe
    - Increased battery pack charging success rate from 99% to 99.5%
    - Battery pack recipe now allows productivity
    - Rocket control unit recipe now requires a charged battery pack instead of cobalt ingot
    - Satellite recipe now requires charged battery packs instead of uncharged battery packs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 11 March 2023
  Features:
    - Added seamounts (underwater mountains) which spawn sparsely in deep oceans
    - Added dredging platforms, which can be placed on seamounts to dredge for polymetallic nodules
      - Dredging platforms have a fixed size
      - Underground belts and electric poles cannot be placed on dredging platforms so they should be powered by charged batteries
      - Polymetallic nodules can be processed on-platform into small, but infinite, sources of iron, copper, and stone
      - The player can choose which type of nodule to dredge for
    - Added cobalt ingots, produced from cobalt crust, which can only be obtained by dredging
      - Cobalt processing produces tailings water as a byproduct, from which lead and titanium ore can be obtained
    - Added technologies for battery charging and battery pack
  Changes:
    - Recipe changes:
      - Replaced steel with titanium in big mining drill recipe
      - Added cobalt ingot to battery pack recipe
      - Added cobalt ingot to rocket control unit recipe
      - Added cobalt ingot to titansteel recipe
      - Added titansteel to plutonium atomic bomb recipe
    - Licence changed from MIT to GPLv3
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed seismic scanner recipe being available from the start of the game
    - Fixed transport science recipe not allowing productivity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.2
Date: 3 March 2023
  Changes:
    - Rails are now half as expensive (so they are now the same as vanilla cost)
    - Transport science recipe now gives 2 science packs instead of 3, and takes 12s instead of 15s
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed lava pools getting destroyed by splash damage attacks
    - Fixed crash on load with Companion Drones
    - Fixed crash with Exotic Industries Containers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 3 March 2023
  Changes:
    - Map generation now generates larger islands
    - Decreased default enemy difficulty and time evolution factor
    - Increased resource frequency, decreased resource size
    - Doubled starting resource count
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2 March 2023
  Features:
    - Added seismic scanner for scanning connected landmasses at a longer range than radar
    - Added battery pack for storing electricity more densely
  Changes:
    - Decreased radar range from 45x45 to 35x35
    - Reduced wood cost of landfill from 2 to 1
    - Rebalanced battery capacity and charging speeds 
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed landfill not being minable
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 1 March 2023
  Features:
    - Added charged battery transportation
      - Battery items can be charged at charging stations
      - Electricity from charged batteries can be released at discharging stations
      - Charged batteries can be loaded into containers
      - Charging and discharging stations share the same graphics for now
  Changes:
    - Reduced stack size of lead, titanium, and uranium ores from 25 to 15
    - Removed floating electric pole
    - Big electric pole and substation recipes now use less steel and more lead
    - Boat travels slightly faster
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 28 February 2023
  Changes:
    - Added slag as a byproduct of titansteel smelting in lava pools
