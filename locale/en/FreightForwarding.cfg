[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
ff-vanilla=This group contains all non-modded tips and tricks.
freight-forwarding=Welcome to Freight Forwarding!\n\nYou must launch an [item=ff-interstellar-communicator] into space to win the game.\n\nDemonstration screenshots and videos will be added in a future update.
ff-containerization=Containers are a new way to transport items.\nItems are loaded onto containers in a [entity=ic-containerization-machine-1]. Each container can hold 20 stacks of that item. Trains and ships have extremely low inventory sizes, so containerizing cargo before transport is essential. If an item cannot be containerized, then that is a hint that you should process it where it is rather than loading it onto trains and ships. 
ff-container-limits=Containers cannot be carried by bots. There are some ways to get this to happen, but they shouldn't be used and may get patched out in future updates.\n\nSpidertrons and aircraft can carry empty containers, but not loaded ones.
ff-water-types=There are three types of water: shallow, regular, and deep water.\n\nPlayers, vehicles, and aliens can all traverse shallow water. Shallow water can be created using [item=waterfill-item].\nLandfill and train bridges can only be placed on shallow or regular water. Landfill can be removed by __ALT_CONTROL__2__mine__ on it with a tile in hand.\nDeep water contains offshore oil and seamounts, and can only be traversed by ships, hovercrafts, and aircraft.
ff-oil=Oil can only be obtained from offshore oil deposits. Each tanker ship can be loaded with up to three [entity=pump]. Hold a pump in hand to see the valid placement positions.\nPumping directly from oil rig to tanker ship is much faster than pumping from underwater pipes.
ff-power=There is no way to transfer electricity over oceans using electric poles. Instead, you must set up individual power generation on each island, or store electricity in [item=ff-charged-battery] using a [entity=ff-charging-station], and transport them by ship or aircraft.
ff-fuel=Some vehicles have unique fuel requirements.\n\nCars, tanks, ships and aircraft accept all regular fuel types: [item=wood] [item=coal] [item=solid-fuel] [item=rocket-fuel] [item=nuclear-fuel]\n[entity=mini-locomotive] accepts only basic fuel types: [item=wood] [item=coal] [item=solid-fuel]\n[entity=locomotive] accepts only batteries: [item=ff-charged-battery] [item=ff-charged-battery-pack] and outputs used batteries which must be removed and recharged. Batteries have a small chance of breaking during charging).
ff-dredging=Dredging platforms can be placed over seamounts.\nDredging for [item=ff-ferrous-nodule] and [item=ff-cupric-nodule] allows infinite production of [item=iron-ore], [item=copper-ore], and [item=stone], to supplement regular resource production.\nDredging for [item=ff-cobalt-crust] allows infinite production of [item=ff-cobalt-ore], which doesn't spawn elsewhere.\nNodules and crusts have low stack sizes and cannot be loaded into containers, so processing them into ores on the dredging platform itself is recommended.\n\nUnderground belts cannot be placed on dredging platforms.
ff-rocket-silo=Rocket silos can only be placed on naturally occuring rocket silo holes.\nYou must launch several [item=satellite] in order to research the [item=ff-interstellar-communicator] necessary to win the game.
